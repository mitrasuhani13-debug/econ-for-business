<!-- ================= WHAT IS ECONOMICS ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>What is Economics?</h2>
  <p>
    Economics is the study of how individuals, businesses, and societies
    allocate scarce resources to satisfy unlimited wants.
  </p>

  <p>
    It examines decision-making under constraints and explains how choices
    are made in the presence of scarcity.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    📌 <strong>In simple terms:</strong> Economics is about choices —
    what to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= SCARCITY ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Scarcity</h2>
  <p>
    Scarcity is the fundamental economic problem. It arises because
    human wants are unlimited, while resources such as time, money,
    labour, and natural resources are limited.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because of scarcity, not all wants can be satisfied simultaneously.
    This forces individuals and firms to make decisions.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    📌 <strong>Example:</strong> A student has limited money but many wants —
    food, travel, entertainment, and books. Scarcity forces prioritisation.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= CHOICE ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Choice</h2>
  <p>
    Due to scarcity, every economic agent must make choices.
    Choosing one option automatically means giving up another.
  </p>

  <p>
    Choices are influenced by preferences, income, prices, and expectations.
    In business, choices are guided by cost-benefit analysis.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    📌 <strong>Example:</strong> A firm choosing to invest in marketing
    may postpone investment in new machinery.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= OPPORTUNITY COST ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Opportunity Cost</h2>
  <p>
    Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative
    that is forgone when a choice is made.
  </p>

  <p>
    It represents the true cost of any decision and plays a crucial role
    in both personal and business decision-making.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    📌 <strong>Example:</strong> If a student spends an evening watching a movie
    instead of studying, the opportunity cost is the learning or grades forgone.
  </p>

<!-- ================= WHY ECONOMICS FOR BUSINESS ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Why Study Economics for Business?</h2>
  <p>
    Economics provides a framework for understanding markets, consumer behaviour,
    production decisions, and pricing strategies.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Helps firms decide optimal prices</li>
    <li>Aids in demand and cost forecasting</li>
    <li>Explains market competition</li>
    <li>Guides policy and strategic decisions</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="example">
    📌 <strong>Example:</strong> Understanding demand elasticity helps firms
    decide whether raising prices will increase or decrease revenue.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= MICRO VS MACRO ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Microeconomics and Macroeconomics</h2>

  <p>
    Economics is broadly divided into two branches:
    <strong>Microeconomics</strong> and <strong>Macroeconomics</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>Microeconomics</h3>
  <p>
    Microeconomics studies individual economic units such as consumers,
    firms, and specific markets.
  </p>

  <h3>Macroeconomics</h3>
  <p>
    Macroeconomics studies the economy as a whole, including inflation,
    unemployment, economic growth, and national income.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    📌 <strong>This course focus:</strong> Economics for Business primarily
    uses microeconomic analysis.
