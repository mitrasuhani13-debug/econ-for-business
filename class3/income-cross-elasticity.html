  <p>How demand responds to income and related goods</p>

<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Why Study Other Elasticities?</h2>
  <p>
    Price is not the only factor affecting demand. Demand also responds
    to changes in consumer income and prices of related goods.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    📌 Income and cross elasticities help firms predict market demand
    under changing economic conditions.
  </p>

<!-- ================= INCOME ELASTICITY ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)</h2>

  <p>
    Income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity
    demanded to a change in consumer income.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    📐 <strong>Formula:</strong><br />
    YED = (% Change in Quantity Demanded) ÷ (% Change in Income)
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= TYPES OF YED ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Types of Goods Based on Income Elasticity</h2>

  <h3>Normal Goods (YED &gt; 0)</h3>
  <p>
    Demand increases as income increases.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Food</li>
    <li>Clothing</li>
    <li>Electronics</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Inferior Goods (YED &lt; 0)</h3>
  <p>
    Demand decreases as income increases.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Low-quality cereals</li>
    <li>Second-hand goods</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= NECESSITIES & LUXURIES ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Necessities vs Luxuries</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Necessities:</strong>  
      YED between 0 and 1 (e.g., basic food, electricity)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Luxuries:</strong>  
      YED &gt; 1 (e.g., cars, vacations, premium phones)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="example">
    📌 As income grows, spending on luxuries rises faster than income.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= NUMERICAL YED ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Numerical Example (Income Elasticity)</h2>

  <p>
    Income increases by 20% and quantity demanded increases by 10%.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    YED = 10% ÷ 20% = <strong>0.5</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Since YED &lt; 1, the good is a <strong>necessity</strong>.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= CROSS ELASTICITY ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED)</h2>

  <p>
    Cross elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity
    demanded of one good to a change in the price of another good.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    📐 <strong>Formula:</strong><br />
    XED = (% Change in Quantity of Good A) ÷ (% Change in Price of Good B)
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= TYPES OF XED ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Types of Goods Based on Cross Elasticity</h2>

  <h3>Substitutes (XED &gt; 0)</h3>
  <p>
    An increase in the price of one good increases demand for the other.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tea and coffee</li>
    <li>Butter and margarine</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Complements (XED &lt; 0)</h3>
  <p>
    An increase in the price of one good decreases demand for the other.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cars and petrol</li>
    <li>Printers and ink cartridges</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Unrelated Goods (XED = 0)</h3>
  <p>
    Change in price of one good does not affect demand for the other.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Books and bread</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= NUMERICAL XED ================= -->
<section class="class-card">
  <h2>Numerical Example (Cross Elasticity)</h2>

  <p>
    Price of coffee rises by 10%, and demand for tea increases by 15%.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    XED = 15% ÷ 10% = <strong>+1.5</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    Tea and coffee are <strong>substitutes</strong>.
